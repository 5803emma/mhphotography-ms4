#### Design

As this is a photography application I wanted the photographer's work to be prevelant in the design. Keeping this in mind I used a background image of a lake just after sunset, so the image is slightly dark. This image allows the cards displaying the packages to stand out and draw the user's eye to them.

##### Font
Using Google Fonts I selected the font Boola-Da throughout the application. 

##### Icons
I utilised font-awesome icons for my social links and also for my nav bar

#### Logo
I designed a logo for Mark Hayes photogrpahy and I have displayed this in my nav-bar, I feel this gives the page a professional look. 

#### Colours
As the background image is slightly darker I decided to make my navbar and footer a bright blue colour in order for them to stand out to the user. Using font #fff the text stands out and makes it easy for the user to see where they can navigate to from whatever page they are on.
